# Code for Orlando Event Parking App

## Description

This app is designed to notify users of upcoming events in Downtown Orlando that could initiate Event Parking. Event Parking is a possible issue for those who need to be downtown during a big event (like a sports game or concert), and may need to reroute or rethink the way they decide to get downtown.

The app is currently fully functional but does not have the data necessary to populate the dates in the calendar. Any assistance in getting the data for Event Parking from the city in a consistent, digestible format would be greatly appreciated.

## How to Use

The app is not currently hosted on any Code for Orlando webspace, so to see the app in action:

1) Clone the repository to your filesystem
2) `cd` into the cloned directory and then `npm install`
3) `npm run start` will serve the application on localhost port 3000
